			<h1>Soular Souls X-VP SDK v.01 Release Notes</h1>
		</a>
		<p>The Soular Souls X-VP SDK provides developers with documentation, header 
			files, and sample code necessary to write software using X-VP. The 
        X-VP SDK Installer simplifies installation by installing the entire X-VP 
        source tree (depending on license type) and all sample code, tutorials 
        and other documentation to your hard disk.&nbsp; It creates several 
        convenient shortcuts on your Windows Start Menu to enable quick access 
        to key components of the installation.</p>
		<h2><br>

        <a name="Prerelease">Prerelease Content </a>
		</h2>
		<p>This version of the X-VP SDK includes prerelease content, enabling 
        you to start developing your application before the technology is 
        released. However, technologies can change prior to their final release. 
        Therefore, you may want to wait until the SDK reaches version 1.0, which 
        will be considered the first stable and fully supported commercial 
        release.&nbsp; If you decide to release your commercial application 
        prior to version 1.0, discounted licenses may be obtained, please see
        <a href="http://www.soularsouls.com">http://www.soularsouls.com</a> for 
        the current offerings.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>For 
			more information, see the license included with this SDK 
        distribution. Additionally, some  material is a 
			preview of new or planned functionality not yet available in the 
        SDK.</p>

		<p>The details of configuring compiler and linker options are described in the <i>Getting 
				Started Guide.&nbsp; </i>The X-VP SDK may require other 3rd 
        party SDKs to be installed in order to function properly such as 
        Microsoft's DirectX or OpenAL.&nbsp; Please see the <i>Getting 
				Started Guide</i> for more information on the setup required for 
        your particular environment.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;</p>
		<h2><a name="Building Applications">Tested Compilers/Build Environments</a></h2>
		<p>The X-VP SDK has been tested with Visual Studio .NET.&nbsp; Over 
        time, we will extend support for other compilers as users will 
        inevitably try others during development.&nbsp; If you are using another 
        system successfully, please let us know so we can add it to the list of 
        supported compilers.&nbsp; Send email to
        <a href="mailto:support@soularsouls.com">support@soularsouls.com</a>.&nbsp; 
			For more information about Visual Studio, see the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/">

		<ul>
			<li>
			Thus far we've only tested 32-bit Windows Systems, but we don't 
            suspect any 64-bit issues.&nbsp; Until such time that X-VP is 
            targeted towards 64-bit operating systems, we cannot officially 
            support X-VP development on 64-bit systems.&nbsp;
			<li>
			At this time, only the Windows XSP is available.
			</ul>
		<h2><br>
        <a name="Development Notes">Tutorials and Sample Code</a></h2>
		<p>The X-VP SDK includes several code examples that demonstrate how to 
        use X-VP.&nbsp; A quick way to access these tutorials is via the Start 
        Menu after X-VP installation.&nbsp; The tutorials start with simple 
        concepts and progress towards more advanced practices.&nbsp; We 
        recommend you start out at the beginning of the tutorials and work your 
        way through them one by one making sure you understand the concepts 
        presented in each one as later tutorials may be combinations of ideas 
        presented in earlier tutorials.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind as you work through the sample code that clarity and 
        ease of explanation were always chosen over optimization and algorithm 
        choice.&nbsp; That means that a tutorial's main goal is to explain the 
        specific topic at hand without clouding the code with excessive error 
        handling or optimizations that might make the code less straight 
        forward.</p>
